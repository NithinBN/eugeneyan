### 👋 Hi, I'm Eugene Yan.

I work at the intersection of consumer data & tech to build ML systems **to help customers**. I also write about effective data science, learning, and career. Currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon Kindle helping users read more. In addition, I'm ...

- 🌱 Learning more about recsys, NLP, and how to [write](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/).
- 👨‍💻 Teaching a [free email course](https://eugeneyan.com/resources/) to help data scientists be more effective.
- 🙌 Looking to collaborate on content and building communities.
- 🗂 Curating [`applied-ml`](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml), a collection of papers & articles on ML applied in production.
- ⌨️ Fun fact: I don't use the QWERTY keyboard (I use [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) instead).
