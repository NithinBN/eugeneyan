### 👋 Hi, I'm Eugene Yan.

I [work](https://eugeneyan.com/about/) at the intersection of consumer data & tech to build ML systems **to help customers**, and [write](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/) about **how to be more effective in data science & machine learning**.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm an [Applied Scientist at Amazon](https://eugeneyan.com/about/) helping users read more, and get more out of books.
- 📝 I write [about](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/) effective data science, learning, and career to help teams and individuals.
- 🎤 I speak [about](https://eugeneyan.com/speaking/) data science & machine learning in production, and data careers.
- 📬 I teach a [free email course](https://eugeneyan.com/resources/) to help data scientists be more effective.
- 📚 I curate [`applied-ml`](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml), a collection of papers & articles on ML applied in production.
- ⌨️ Fun fact: I don't use the QWERTY keyboard (I use [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) instead).
